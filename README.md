# Gear to Gear Planner

## Summary
Gear to gear planner is a small addon developed for World of Warcraft Classic. It allows to export currently equipped gear and selected talents to a valid [Classic Gearplanner Url](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner).

The functionality is very minimal. The only user command it adds in-game is the "/gtgp" command, which will pop-up a small window with the generated url selected. From there the user only needs to copy-paste the url in the browser and voila. That's all there is to it.

## Usage
Gear to gear planner provides a single command ingame: "/gtgp".
Using this command will bring up a pop-up with the corresponding wowhead gearplanner url inside the textbox. At this point you can simply CTRL-C and CTRL-V the url into your browser.
