# Gear to Gear Planner
Gear to gear planner is a small addon developed for World of Warcraft Classic. It allows to export currently equipped gear and selected talents to a valid [Classic Gearplanner Url](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner).

The functionality is very minimal. The only user command it adds in-game is the "/gtgp" command, which will pop-up a small window with the generated url selected. From there the user only needs to copy-paste the url in the browser and voila. That's all there is to it.
